# Zomato-Case-Study-using-SQL
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based case study focused on a food delivery application. The case study explores the database design and management aspects of the application, demonstrating how various tables interact and store relevant information. The project encompasses seven essential tables that represent different entities within the application's ecosystem:

User Table: This table stores information about the users of the food delivery app, including details such as user ID, name, emails and other relevant attributes.

Restaurant Table: The restaurant table contains essential data about the registered restaurants. It includes attributes like restaurant ID, name, location, menu, and other relevant information.

Food Table: This table houses details about the various food items available for delivery. It includes attributes like food ID, name and other relevant information.

Menu Table: The menu table acts as an intermediary between restaurants and food items, mapping the available food options to their respective restaurants. It contains attributes such as menu ID, restaurant ID, food ID, and additional information for efficient retrieval and management.

Delivery Partner Table: This table stores information about the delivery partners associated with the food delivery app. It includes attributes such as partner ID, name and other relevant information.

Order Details Table: The order details table captures specific information about individual food items within an order. It includes attributes such as order details ID, order ID, food ID and any additional relevant information.

Orders Table: This table serves as the central entity for tracking and managing orders within the food delivery app. It includes attributes like order ID, user ID, restaurant ID, delivery partner ID, date, rating and other pertinent information.

By examining and interacting with these tables, this case study provides valuable insights into the data structure and relationships within a food delivery app's database. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding SQL database design, querying, and management techniques in the context of a real-world application.
